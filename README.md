  ## 2. Movie Recommendations Based on Linear Regression Algorithm
  
  CRLRM (Category based Recommendation using Linear Regression Model) which is based on linear regression model that improves the prediction accuracy and speed up the calculations. Performance of proposed method is evaluated on the basis of MAE (Mean Absolute Error) comparison, and result obtained is far much better than ERPM and shows improvement in 30-40% of user ratings

  ## 3.Movie Recommendations Based on Content Based "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"
  
  It uses attributes such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make suggestions for the users. The intuition behind this sort of recommendation system is that if a user liked a particular movie or show, he/she might like a movie or a show similar to it.

  ## 4.Movie Recommendations Based on user and item based collabrative algorithm
  
  It matches users with same interests and gives recommendations based on their likes. Eg: There are two users Sam and Robin, Sam likes movies A,B,C,D and Robin likes movies C,D. Since movies C,D are common to both Sam and Robin, thus movies A and B would be recommended to Robin. Collaborative filtering does not make use of metadata to give recommendations.
